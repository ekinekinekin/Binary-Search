## Problem Breakdown & Computational Thinking (You can add a flowchart and write the
four pillars of computational thinking briefly in bullets)

I chose binary search as I found it to be both simple to code but complex enough to give my app a creative concept.

1. Decomposition
   
binary search:

-sort the list of numbers
-set left & right boundaries
-calculate the middle index
-compare the middle number with the target
-if not found eliminate half of the list
-repeat until success or failure

2. Pattern Recognition

each loop:

-check the middle
-remove half
-repeat
-always divides the problem into two

3. Abstraction

only show:

-current checked index
-colour coded status of numbers
-text log
-final result: mouse found / not found

4. Algorithim Design

input: list of numbers and target
output: visual and explanation
