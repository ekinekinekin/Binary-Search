# Algorithm Name
Binary Search

## Problem Breakdown & Computational Thinking (You can add a flowchart and write the
four pillars of computational thinking briefly in bullets)

I chose binary search as I found it to be both simple to code but complex enough to give my app a creative concept.

1. Decomposition
   
binary search:

-sort the list of numbers
-set left & right boundaries
-calculate the middle index
-compare the middle number with the target
-if not found eliminate half of the list
-repeat until success or failure

2. Pattern Recognition

each loop:

-check the middle
-remove half
-repeat
-always divides the problem into two

3. Abstraction

only show:

-current checked index
-colour coded status of numbers
-text log
-final result: mouse found / not found

4. Algorithim Design

input: list of numbers and target
output: visual and explanation

## Steps to Run
(locally)
1. download github repository

2. install required dependencies

3. run the app

4. open the gradio link shown in terminal

(hugging face)
1. go to hugging face link

2. enter list of numbers and target

3. click start/reset

4. click next to step through the search
